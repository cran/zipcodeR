### Makes dealing with U.S. ZIP codes painless.

**zipcodeR** is an R library that makes working with ZIP codes in R easier. It provides data on all U.S. ZIP codes using multiple open data sources, making it easier for social science researchers and data scientists to work with ZIP code-level data in projects. 

## Installation
Install the current release from CRAN:
```r
install.packages('zipcodeR')
```

The latest development version can be installed like so using devtools:
``` r
devtools::install_github('gavinrozzi/zipcodeR', ref = "develop")
```
## Usage
``` r
# Load the zipcodeR library into R
library(zipcodeR)

# Find all ZIP codes for a state
search_state('NJ')

# Find all ZIP codes for a county
search_county('Ocean','NJ')

# Find ZIP codes for a city
